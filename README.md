# react-hover-video-player

[![Travis][build-badge]][build]
[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

React component which manages playing a video when the user hovers over it and pausing when they stop.

Also provides support for displaying custom overlays on top of the video while it is in a paused or loading state.

NOTE that this is still very much a work in progress. Things that remain to be done:

- Add mobile touch support
- Improve test coverage
- Fill out documentation
- Optimize package size
