React component which manages playing a video when the user hovers over it and pausing when they stop.

Also provides support for displaying custom overlays on top of the video while it is in a paused or loading state.

NOTE that this is still very much a work in progress. Things that remain to be done:

- Fill out documentation
- Add option to set timeout before loading state starts showing
